zed_cpu_ros
===========
A simple zed camera driver which only use CPU and only publish left and right raw images and its camera info.

# Usage:
1. git the packge into your working space

    ```
    cd catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/transcendrobotics/zed_cpu_ros
    cd ..
    catkin_make
    ```
2. Get your calibration files:
    You can get your calibration files from zed or do a calibration your self by using ROS camera calibration package.

    (1). From zed:

    Find your zed calibration files in
    ```
    cd /usr/local/zed/settings
    ```
    or download from:
    http://calib.stereolabs.com/?SN=XXXX

    Note: XXXX is your last four digit S/N of your camera, make sure to change it!!

    put the .conf file into zed_cpu_ros/config folder

    update launch file configuration file name in zed_cpu_ros.launch into your SNXXXX.conf
    ```
    roscd zed_cpu_ros/launch
    gedit zed_cpu_ros.launch
    ```
    change XXXX into the .conf file you have, for example 1010
    ```
    <arg name="config_file_location" default="$(find zed_cpu_ros)/config/SN1010.conf"/>
    ```

    (2). Do a calibration yourself:

    This option is suggested. Reference: http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration
    ```
    roslaunch zed_cpu_ros camera_calibration.launch
    ```
    After calibration:
    Find the left.yaml and right.yaml in the tar file and put them into the zed_cpu_ros/config folder.
    The calibration file will be loaded if you turn <load_zed_config> off in the launch file.

3. launch the code
    ```
    roslaunch zed_cpu_ros zed_cpu_ros.launch
    ```
